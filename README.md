# Stats preview card component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello friends, thanks for checking this out. This is a practice project provided by https://www.frontendmentor.io/. They are seriously good, if you are looking to hone your front end skills. So, you can check out this awesome site.

This project is basically a stats preview card. Here, we have to style the site along with keeping in mind about the different type of users(desktop-based, mobile-based), i.e. we would need to use media-queries here in order to make this site/page/component flexible and responsive as well.
